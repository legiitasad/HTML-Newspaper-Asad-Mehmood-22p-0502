## Project Description
This project recreates the front page layout of a historic Urdu newspaper (Daily Mashriq, 1979) using HTML only. 
The layout reflects a traditional newspaper structure with masthead, banner headline, multi-column stories, and a boxed feature section. 
All headlines and content were translated into English and rephrased in original wording.

## Features Implemented
- Proper HTML5 document structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Semantic HTML tags: `header`, `nav`, `section`, `article`, `footer`
- Three-column newspaper layout using an HTML `table`
- Inline styles for basic formatting (no external CSS, no JavaScript)
- Multiple images with meaningful `alt` attributes
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` to `h4`)
- Lists (`ul` and `ol`) used for structured content
- HTML comments and consistent indentation

## Challenges Faced
Recreating a newspaper-style layout without external CSS was challenging. 
This was addressed by using table-based columns and inline styles to control spacing, borders, and visual hierarchy while keeping the layout readable.
